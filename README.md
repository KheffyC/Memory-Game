Memory Game is a project modeled off of childhood memory games. Designed to be used for mental stimulation.  
***
## Description
This game will show a set amount of tiles for 3 seconds before vanishing. Once the tiles vanish, the game begins. 

In this game you will have to use your memory to click on the correct tiles that were once highlighted. If you dont choose all the correct tiles in under 15 seconds, **you lose**! 


_Remember not to click on too many random tiles, you only get a certain amount of chances before game over_!

## Features

Memory Game consists of 5 levels, each one increasing in size and difficulty: 


- **Clean, simple design** - With Memory Game, the Tile Board is the main attraction. The timer, guess count, and level of difficulty are paired closely to the side of the board for easy readability. The intro screen leaves nothing up for interpretation, all text fields are enabled as the user progresses. 

- **Level Progression** - With every win the player can progress on to the next level, further testing their memorization abilities. In every win modal (as well as the top right of the screen), players will get an updated score count to acknowledge their successful completion of the board. 

- **New set of tiles on reset** - If you fail to progress to the next level, you can always try again. _But the tile board wont ever be the same board twice_. With a randomized tile sequence, the fun never ends!
